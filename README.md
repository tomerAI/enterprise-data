# Enterprise Data Manager

A sophisticated data management system that combines graph-based structured data processing with embeddings-based unstructured data analysis, designed for enterprise-scale data operations.

## 🎯 Vision

Enterprise Data Manager aims to provide a unified solution for handling both structured and unstructured data by:
- Using graph databases for modeling complex relationships in structured data
- Leveraging embeddings and vector storage for semantic understanding of unstructured data
- Providing an intuitive API for data ingestion, processing, and retrieval

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **FastAPI Backend**: RESTful API service for data operations
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Vector-enabled database for storing embeddings
- **Graph Database** *(planned)*: For structured data relationships
- **OpenAI Integration**: For generating high-quality embeddings
- **DBT**: For data transformation and modeling

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. File ingestion through REST API
2. Data processing based on file type
3. Structured data → Graph representation
4. Unstructured data → Embeddings generation
5. Deduplication and storage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key
- Python 3.9+

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with required configurations:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/dbname
   ```
3. Run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## 📋 Current Features
- FastAPI-based REST API
- Docker containerization
- CSV file ingestion capability
- OpenAI-powered embeddings generation
- Document deduplication
- Vector storage with pgvector
- DBT integration for data transformations

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### High Priority
1. Implement graph database integration
   - Select and integrate a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
   - Migrate CSV processor to use graph structure
   - Develop graph query endpoints

2. Enhance Data Processing
   - Add support for more file formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
   - Implement batch processing capabilities
   - Add data validation and cleaning pipeline

3. Improve Vector Operations
   - Implement semantic search endpoints
   - Add clustering capabilities
   - Optimize vector storage and retrieval

### Medium Priority
1. Security Enhancements
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add audit logging
   - Enhance API authentication

2. Performance Optimization
   - Add caching layer
   - Implement async processing for large files
   - Optimize database queries

### Future Considerations
- Real-time data processing pipeline
- Machine learning model integration
- Data lineage tracking
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- API rate limiting and quotas

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
